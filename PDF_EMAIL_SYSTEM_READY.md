## 🎨 **TAX SYSTEM DETAILS:**

### **How Flexible Tax Works:**

**In Invoice/Quote Form:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Apply Tax                [ON/OFF]   │
│ Enable tax calculation for this     │
│ invoice/quote                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

When ON:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tax Rate (%)          [15    ]      │
│ Current tax: $225.00                │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Tax Calculation:**
- **Tax ON**: `tax = subtotal × (taxRate / 100)`
- **Tax OFF**: `tax = 0`
- **Total**: `total = subtotal + tax - discount`

**In Totals Display:**
```
Subtotal:     $1,500.00
Tax (15%):    $  225.00  ← Only shown if tax is ON
─────────────────────────
Total:        $1,725.00
```

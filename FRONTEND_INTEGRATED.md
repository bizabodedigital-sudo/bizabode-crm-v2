```
Component → Zustand Store → API Client → MongoDB → ✅ Persists forever
```

## 🔍 API Calls Being Made

When you open a page, check browser DevTools → Network:

### **Inventory Page:**
```
GET /api/items?limit=1000
→ Returns all items from MongoDB
```

### **Leads Page:**
```
GET /api/leads?limit=1000
→ Returns all leads from MongoDB
```

### **Opportunities Page:**
```
GET /api/opportunities?limit=1000
→ Returns all opportunities from MongoDB
```

### **When You Add an Item:**
```
POST /api/items
Body: { sku, name, quantity, ... }
→ Creates item in MongoDB
→ Returns created item
→ Updates UI instantly
```

### **When You Edit an Item:**

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

### **Loading States:**
- Spinner shows while data loads
- Prevents flash of "No items found"
- Better user feedback

### **Error Handling:**
- Errors logged to console
- Can add toast notifications next

### **Optimistic Updates:**
- UI updates immediately
- Real data loads in background
- Seamless experience

---

## 🚀 What Still Uses Mock Data

These need to be updated next (same pattern):

### **Quotes** (`lib/quotes-invoices-store.ts`)
- Currently uses `demoQuotes`
- Needs `fetchQuotes()` method
- API ready at `/api/quotes`

### **Invoices** (`lib/quotes-invoices-store.ts`)
- Currently uses `demoInvoices`
- Needs `fetchInvoices()` method
- API ready at `/api/invoices`

### **Dashboard Stats** (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- Currently shows hardcoded numbers
- Should fetch real metrics
- Can calculate from database

---

## 📈 Next Steps

### **Priority 1: Update Quotes & Invoices** (30 min)
Same pattern as inventory/leads:
1. Update `lib/quotes-invoices-store.ts`
2. Add API calls instead of mock data
3. Add `fetchQuotes()` and `fetchInvoices()`
4. Update components to call fetch on mount

### **Priority 2: Add Toast Notifications** (20 min)
```typescript
import { toast } from "sonner"

// On success:
toast.success("Item added successfully!")

// On error:
toast.error("Failed to add item")
```

### **Priority 3: Real Dashboard Data** (30 min)
Calculate from MongoDB:
- Total revenue from invoices
- Active opportunities count
- Inventory count
- Active leads count
